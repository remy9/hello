			 <h2><strong>Urban Ecological Infrastructure &amp; Design</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A contemporary city is a &ldquo;node of energy and material consumption,&rdquo; but it is not sustainable in the sense that the ecological footprint (in terms of natural capital) needed to support the urban population is several hundreds time greater than the city&rsquo;s physical footprint (Rees, 1996). Cities pull on ecological resources and dispose of waste far outside the physical limits of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been suggested that urban sustainability will require no less than the reconstruction of our cities, and that sustainable urban (re)design will need to consider the &ldquo;resource flows for neighborhood developments or entire cities,&rdquo; or in other words, &ldquo;to design the urban metabolism of sustainable cities&rdquo; (Kennedy, 2011). This kind of thinking requires planners and engineers to consider how retrofits to physical infrastructure can be ecologically regenerative i.e. by integrating water-based, vegetative, and non-living landscapes in such a way as to provide urban residents with the ecosystem services they need, while also improving a city&rsquo;s ecological integrity and sustainability (Liu, 2017).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, there has been focus on sanitation and waste treatment as opportunities to recover resources from sanitation systems (Ddiba, 2016). One example is ecological sanitation, the principle of closing the cycle between sanitation and agriculture by recycling the nutrients in urine and feces into compost (Langergraber, 2005). The use of a dry toilet based on ecological sanitation principles has the following benefits: 1) reducing water consumption, 2) reducing downstream expenses and operational inefficiencies associated with treatment and disposal of sewerage, and 3) recycling nutrients into compost to improve soil quality.</p>
<h2>
	<strong>Composting Toilets at the University of Victoria</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While it is unlikely that all retrofits to urban infrastructure will result in cost savings as well as improved resource efficiency, there are some &ldquo;low-hanging fruit&rdquo;-type projects that are sustainable from both an economic and ecological perspective; these should be implemented as soon as possible. The University of Victoria has a campus sustainability fund available to finance such projects (Campus Planning, 2016); would retrofitting composting toilets be eligible for such financing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In one of the civil engineering graduate buildings, E Hut, there are six flush toilets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assumptions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of people in the building per day: 30</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of flushes per person per day: 5 (RWPC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume of water used per flush: 1.6 gallon (RWPC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of working days per year: 260 days</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 264 gallons per m<sup>3</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost of water: $2.212 per m<sup>3</sup></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
	    <p style="text-align: justify;">Estimated annual water savings:</p>
        <img src="/water savings calculation.jpg" alt="Composting Toilet Water Savings">
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be under the five-year recommended payback period, the retrofit investment would have to be less than five times the annual water savings, or $2,614.18. This comes out to $435.70 per toilet retrofitted. Many higher-tech commercial composting toilets, like the Envirolet toilet manufactured in Canada, cost several thousand dollars per unit to install.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the short-term economic benefits for retrofitting are not sufficient, perhaps rendering this proposal idea ineligible. But is there a moral argument to be made?</p>

			 <h2><strong>Sooke Lake Watershed & Reservoir Field Trip</strong></h2>
	    
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last Friday we went on a tour of the Sooke Lake Watershed and Reservoir, which is the watershed that supplies water to more than 370,000 people in the Greater Victoria region. <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/">Capital Regional District (CRD)</a> is the regional government of southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands and is responsible for the region’s supply of water, managing the associated watershed and reservoirs, and hosted the tour we took on Friday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tour was 5 ½ hours long, and it was both comprehensive and entertaining! We learned how CRD is taking an integrated and long-term thinking approach to managing our water supply. We learned how the CRD is approaching water demand management, how they’re considering the impact of population growth and climate change, and how and why the forest in the watershed area needs to be managed well.</p>
	    <img src="/fieldtrip.jpeg" alt="Field Trip Photo">
	    <p style="text-align: justify;"><h2><strong>Demand management</h2></strong><p> CRD has managed to keep water supply demand constant over the past five to ten years even though the region’s population grew. They shared that this was possible by incentivizing retrofits of low-flow toilets and showers. CRD has looked at other demand management schemes like <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/water-pdf/conser568.pdf?sfvrsn=2">conservation-oriented water rate structures</a>, but we left the tour discussing other impactful demand management schemes that we’ve seen or heard of elsewhere like incentivizing native plant gardens (instead of grassy lawns that need a lot of irrigation), rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, and composting toilets. If we used treated water for only what we needed it for, what population could the Sooke Lake reservoir support? How can we promote policy and implementation to encourage this kind of demand management? Could deferred investment costs in backup infrastructure be applied toward incentivizing demand management?</p>
	    <p style="text-align: justify;"><h2><strong>Population growth & climate change</h2></strong><p> The primary supply of Greater Victoria’s water is Sooke Lake. The Sooke Lake is recharged by rainfall, and the current turbidity of the lake is so low that the current water treatment system is very simple: UV disinfection followed by chlorination. However, CRD is trying to mitigate the risks of insufficient water supply caused by increased demand through population growth and/or decreased supply caused by climate change. CRD has a 30+ year plan to bring another watershed and reservoir online to manage this uncertainty.</p>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;"><h2><strong>Forest management</h2></strong><p> Because the water supply is unfiltered, forest fires pose a risk by introducing ash in the lake, which can increase turbidity. This has an impact on both the aesthetic and public health characteristics of the water. The reservoir’s forestry management is thus primarily concerned with minimizing fire risk. The primary strategy is managing the forest stock such that the structure simulates an old growth forest characteristic to this region: Douglas firs transitioning to hemlock and big-leaf maple. We also learned that we should hate the very flammable and invasive Scotch broom!</p>
